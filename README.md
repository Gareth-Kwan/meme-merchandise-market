## Description

Our Shiba Inu Meme Merchandise is a web application created using the MERN stack. The front-end would be built with React and would allow users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout. The back-end would be built using Node.js and Express and would handle user authentication, order processing, and data storage. To store product data, the back-end would use a MongoDB database. The front-end and back-end would communicate using a RESTful API. Overall, building an e-commerce website using the MERN stack would be a great way to showcase full-stack development skills, as it involves working with multiple technologies and building complex functionality.

## Purpose

As a student, building an e-commerce coding project also provides an opportunity to learn and practice full-stack development skills, such as front-end development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React framework, back-end development with a framework like Node.js and Express, and database management with MongoDB. It also involves building complex functionality, such as user authentication, data storage, and data retrieval, and integrating multiple technologies to create a seamless user experience.

Overall, the purpose of an e-commerce coding project is to provide a practical and challenging project for us to showcase our coding skills, while also creating a valuable product for businesses and customers alike.

## Education

This project allowed us to use the MERN stack to create an e-commerce web project, we have gained valuable skills in full-stack development, front-end and back-end development, database management, API design, and Heroku deployment. These skills are highly in demand in the tech industry and can prepare us for a successful career as a web developer.
